Gradient descent example using simple regression

example set = {1,2,3,4,5}
mean = total_sum_of_set/total_number_in_set = (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3  . np.mean(example_set)

standard_deviation = Rootover of Addition of How much each nimber in a set is deviated from the mean of the set in square formula devided by total number. if mean is 3 then = ((1-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 + (3-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (5-3)^2)/5-1 = (4+1+0+1+4)/5= 10/5 = 2 =  rootover(2) = 1.41

Histogram: You can see roughly where the peaks of the distribution are. in a histogram. The higher the bins data is separated more. is a chart that plots the distribution of a numeric variableâ€™s values as a series of bars

Normal Distribution (Gaussian): Bell curve in 2-d kartesian plot. the bell curve gives you a visual representation of how your data is distributed around the mean. in this case 3. For a small dataset like  the curve might not be very smooth, but with larger datasets, it helps to understand the distribution and variability of your data.
The normal distribution curve created using the mean (3) and standard deviation (1.41). This curve represents the theoretical distribution of data if it were to follow a normal distribution. 
Normal distro is used for linear regression. Not all set will behave like a bell curve. Best way to see if a dataset is normally distributed or not isto see the histogram chart
it is also for Exploratory Data Analysis and probabilistic thinking that next number should be around the mean or top of the bell
Normal distribution is to use: 
    If your histogram closely matches the normal distribution curve, it suggests that your data is approximately normally distributed.
    If there are significant deviations, it indicates skewness, outliers, or a different distribution type, guiding you in further analysis or data transformation.
