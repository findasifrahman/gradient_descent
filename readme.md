Gradient descent example using simple regression

example set = {1,2,3,4,5}
mean = total_sum_of_set/total_number_in_set = (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3  . np.mean(example_set)

standard_deviation = Rootover of Addition of How much each nimber in a set is deviated from the mean of the set in square formula devided by total number. if mean is 3 then = ((1-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 + (3-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (5-3)^2)/5-1 = (4+1+0+1+4)/5= 10/5 = 2 =  rootover(2) = 1.41

Normal Distribution (Gaussian) = Bell curve in 2-d kartesian plot.
